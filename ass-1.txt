        All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and 
        JavaScript.These are the languages of the web.<br/>

        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure
        <br/> and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).<br/>

        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images,
        <br/> video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
            <nav>
                <ol>
                    <li> The opening tag</li>
                    <li>The closing tag </li>
                    <li>The actual element </li>
                 </ol>
            </nav>
